Situation:
In the real estate market, determining the fair market value of a property is a crucial step for both buyers and sellers. 
Traditionally, Comparative Market Analysis (CMA) has been performed by real estate agents and appraisers, who manually analyze the 
prices of similar properties in the area to estimate the value of a home. This process relies heavily on historical data and 
subjective judgment, which can be time-consuming and prone to errors. As the volume of property transactions increases, these 
traditional methods become inefficient and may lead to less accurate pricing estimates.

Complication:
However, as the real estate market becomes more complex and competitive, traditional CMA methods struggle to keep up. Real 
estate professionals often face challenges due to the vast amounts of data, rapidly changing market conditions, and missing 
property information, such as renovations, age of the home, or features like pools or garages. These gaps make it difficult 
to provide timely and reliable pricing estimates. Without a more efficient and accurate way to automate price predictions, 
stakeholders risk making suboptimal decisions, leading to either overpaying or underpricing properties.

Question:
How can we improve the accuracy, speed, and efficiency of the CMA process? Can machine learning be applied to predict future 
sale prices by learning from past data, and how can we overcome the challenges posed by missing information and fluctuating 
market conditions?

Answer:
The solution lies in ProphetCMA, a machine learning-based approach trained on previous house sale prices to predict future 
sale prices. By learning from historical data, ProphetCMA automates the CMA process, providing faster and more accurate price 
predictions. The machine learning model uses key property features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, and bathrooms 
to generate predictions, eliminating the need for subjective judgment and significantly improving scalability. Although the 
method currently shows strong performance within a specific price range, further refinement of the model, including better 
feature engineering and data augmentation, will increase its accuracy for a broader range of homes. ProphetCMA offers real 
estate professionals, homebuyers, and property investors a powerful tool to make data-driven, informed pricing decisions 
without relying on traditional methods.
